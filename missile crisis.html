        <p>RUSSIAN MISSILES IN BRAZIL<br><br>
        russian forces planted nuclear missiles in cuba in 1962. but recently in 1990 a johnson calderez
        leaked the marked location to special forces, who relocated the russian missiles to a secure location.
        brandon richardson, william trenton, and caleb davis were all arrested and are held at |||||||| prison in ||||||||||||||||||,
        convicted with illegal transfership and possesion of 17 soviet nuclear warheads. testimonys from the convicted can not be heard 
        by the public. the brazillian government has taken the warheads to |||||||||| and plan to safely dispose of them
        in the southern pacific. small peices of their interogation had been given to the press and we will release them here.<br><br>
        brandon richardson: we were given a job. they said to keep them hidden as long as possible in the mantiqueira mountains.<br>
        william trenton: we were a special group of armed forces, served in the russian military. then we were paired up with caleb, nice fellow. we all guarded the warheads in case of the need for them. but when the U.S.S.R. collapsed we decided to keep them out of everyones hands. do you know the fear of 17 nuclear bombs being repossesed by any country?<br>
        caleb davis: damn johnson. do you know where he is? heh, of course I can't know. if only i could tell them we failed.<br>
